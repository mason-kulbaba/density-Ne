## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

Plots can also be included, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Plots

We showed a simple plot above, here is a more complicated one.

#### Make Up Data

Simulate regression data, and do the regression.
```{r}
n <- 50
x <- seq(1, n)
a.true <- 3
b.true <- 1.5
y.true <- a.true + b.true * x
s.true <- 17.3
y <- y.true + s.true * rnorm(n)
out1 <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(out1)
```

#### Figure with Code to Make It Shown

The following figure is produced by the following code
```{r fig.align='center', fig.cap='Simple Linear Regression', label='regression'}

mydata <- data.frame(x, y)
plot(mydata)
``````
